Sketch-Based Animation System

Overview
A dynamic platform for creating, animating, and interacting with sketches. Inspired by Kitty and Draco, this project merges artistic creativity with cutting-edge computer graphics, allowing users to design and animate vibrant illustrations using interactive tools.

Features
Sketching Tools: Brushes, erasers, and color palettes for seamless drawing.
Animation: Frame interpolation, playback controls, and sprite-based animation.
Kinetic Textures: Particle effects with customizable masks and directions.
Graph-Based Interactions: Nodes and edges for connecting animations, enabling time-synchronized effects.
Future Potential: Chain reactions for cascading animations.

Technologies
Graphics Library: OpenGL
Programming Language: C++

Challenges
Implementing recursion for relational graphs.
Limited global color palette (future iteration planned).
Primitive rotation artifacts (quaternions under consideration).

Results
Functional tools for sketch creation, manipulation, and animation.
Demonstration: Animated boiling water using a gas stove interaction.
